Each task has one or more subtasks associated with it. There is one indexing subtask for each index volume to be processed.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Tasks and their subtasks are controlled by Enterprise Vault's Index Administration Task. You can display and manage indexing tasks and subtasks in the Monitor Indexing Tasks page.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note that you cannot use the indexing wizards to create new tasks for archives, index volumes, and index locations that have other incomplete indexing subtasks associated with them. Archives, index volumes, and index locations must have either no indexing tasks associated with them, or only indexing tasks that have completed before you can submit further tasks.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The following list describes some situations in which you might not be able to add a new task:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Any archive that has an existing task associated with it cannot be added to a new task. Note that some archives have more than one associated index volume. If just one of these index volumes has a task associated with it, you cannot add the archive to a new task.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Index volumes that all belong to one archive can be hosted in different index locations. In this case, a task that is associated with just one archive can create tasks that make more than one index location unavailable in the indexing wizards.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>In some of the indexing wizards, you cannot select an empty index location. For example, you cannot select an empty source index location in the Change Location wizard because it contains no index volumes that can be moved.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>When you use the Change Location wizard, both the source location and the destination location are unavailable until the change location task has completed.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>When you search for archives and index volumes in the indexing wizards, by default search results include archives and index volumes that already have tasks associated with them. In your searches, you can choose to exclude any archives and index volumes with associated tasks if you want to see only those that are available for you to select.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>If you need to add new tasks for archives, index volumes and index locations that have associated tasks, you must first wait for the tasks to complete. Use the Monitor Indexing Tasks page, including its subtask view to see the progress of tasks.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>In situations where you cannot wait for a task or subtasks to complete, you must first stop then delete the relevant existing tasks. Use the Monitor Indexing Tasks page, including its subtask view to stop and delete tasks.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note that you must also delete failed tasks before you can submit new tasks for affected archives, index volumes and index locations.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>More Information</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><a class="xref" href="managing-indexing-tasks.md" data-attr-href="managing-indexing-tasks.md" data-attr-format="dita" data-attr-type="topic">Managing indexing tasks</a></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
