Use the wizard to select the archives whose index volumes you want to upgrade to Elasticsearch. You can select only archives that have one or more 32-bit or 64-bit index volumes.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The 32-bit and 64-bit index volumes remain searchable during the upgrade to avoid impact on users.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note:</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The Upgrade wizard is absent from the Manage Indexes Wizard if there are no 32-bit or 64-bit index volumes, such as in a new installation of Enterprise Vault.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Archives that were created by Enterprise Vault 9 or earlier have one or more 32-bit index volumes. Journal archives typically have multiple index volumes. Other types of archive such as mailbox archives usually have only one index volume.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For all archive types, the Enterprise Vault upgrade closes the old 32-bit or 64-bit index volumes and creates a new, live Elasticsearch index volume for each archive. Subsequently when users search their archives, Enterprise Vault uses the content from the 32-bit, 64-bit, and Elasticsearch index volumes.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>When you use the Upgrade wizard to upgrade 32-bit or 64-bit index volumes to Elasticsearch, it consolidates 32-bit or 64-bit index volumes if it can to create fewer Elasticsearch index volumes. In the case of journal archives, this consolidation excludes the new Elasticsearch index volume that was created during the upgrade to Enterprise Vault 14.2. For all other archive types however, the upgrade includes the new Elasticsearch volume in the consolidation.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
