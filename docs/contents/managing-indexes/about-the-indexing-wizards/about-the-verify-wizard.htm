The wizard lets you select individual archives to verify all their associated index volumes, and you can select individual index volumes. Alternatively, you can select an entire index location to verify all the index volumes it contains.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>During verification, if a subtask finds no errors in an index volume that was previously marked as failed, it clears the failed status automatically.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Each time you run the wizard, you can choose one of the following verification levels:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Basic: Checks that the index volume is accessible and healthy.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Complete: Checks that the index volume is accessible and healthy, and completes an item level verification.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>For 32-bit and 64-bit index volumes, complete verification checks for missing items in the index. These are items that are present in the archive but have not been indexed. For 64-bit archives only, this option also checks for orphaned items, which are index entries for items that do not exist in the archive.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>By default, complete verification does not log individual items that are missing content, such as attachments that have not been indexed because they are encrypted. Only the total number of items that are missing content is listed in the log file. If you want each item that is missing content to be logged individually, select the Include content missing details option when you initiate a complete verification task.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>During complete verification, users can search their archives but no new entries are added to the index volumes.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Each time you run the Verify wizard, you can choose to create a synchronization task automatically for each index volume in which it encounters missing items and orphaned index entries.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
