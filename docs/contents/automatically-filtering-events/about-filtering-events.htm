Event filtering is enabled by default.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>By default, event filtering does not suppress Informational events. You can choose to enable filtering for specific Informational events or for all Informational events. If you enable filtering for all events, Enterprise Vault never suppresses any events that help you to track the progress of a task. For example, event filtering does not suppress Informational events that enable you to track the progress of PST migration.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Event filtering does not affect DTrace. All events are written to DTrace, even those that have been suppressed and so do not appear in the event log. If you need to use tracing there is no need to disable event filtering.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
