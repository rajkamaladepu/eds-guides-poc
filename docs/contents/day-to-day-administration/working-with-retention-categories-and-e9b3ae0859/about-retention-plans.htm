The extra settings that you can apply with a retention plan include the following:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>A classification policy</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>One or more retention folders</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>The criteria for discarding expired items</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>Applying a retention plan to an archive gives you greater control over the retention periods of the items in the archive. In particular, a retention plan lets you dispose of already-archived items by giving them a different retention period than the one that Enterprise Vault first gave them when it archived the items. For example, you can configure a retention plan so that Enterprise Vault expires the affected items according to the retention category that you have associated with the retention plan, and not the retention categories that Enterprise Vault originally assigned to them.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>About classification policies</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>If you choose to set a classification policy with a retention plan then, for the archives to which you assign the retention plan, the classification policy determines the following:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Whether to classify items at the same time that Enterprise Vault indexes and archives them. After Enterprise Vault has applied the classification tags, users of applications like Compliance Accelerator and Discovery Accelerator can use them to filter items when they conduct searches and reviews.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Whether to classify items when users manually delete them or Enterprise Vault automatically expires them.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>For more information on the classification feature, see the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">Classification</i><span> guides.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>About retention folders</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note:</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The retention folders that are described here differ from the Domino and File System Archiving retention folders that are described elsewhere in the Enterprise Vault documentation. You create Domino and File System Archiving retention folders on the sources from which Enterprise Vault archives items, but you create the retention folders that are described here in the archives themselves.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>In this release, you can create this second type of retention folder in Exchange archives and Internet Mail archives only.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The retention folder feature lets you control the retention and expiry of archived items at the folder level within your users' archives. Use this feature to create a single retention folder or a hierarchy of folders in these archives. The attributes that you set for each retention folder determine the retention and expiry settings that Enterprise Vault applies to the items in the folder. For example, you can create a folder that applies a retention category with a one-year retention period to the items, overriding the retention categories that Enterprise Vault has previously applied to them. You can further choose whether the subfolders of the retention folder inherit their retention and expiry settings from it or have their own settings.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The retention and expiry settings that you define for a retention folder override those that you define elsewhere in Enterprise Vault, such as in the associated retention plan or at the site level.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Through facilities such as Virtual Vault, Enterprise Vault Search, and IMAP, users can access the retention folders and move items into or out of them.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
