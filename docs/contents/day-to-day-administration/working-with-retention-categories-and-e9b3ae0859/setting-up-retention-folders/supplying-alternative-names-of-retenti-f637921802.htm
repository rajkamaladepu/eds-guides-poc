For example, suppose that some users in your organization employ English and others employ French. When you define the attributes of a retention folder, you can supply one folder name to suit the English users and an alternative folder name to suit the French users.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>This feature overcomes a limitation in earlier versions of Enterprise Vault: the need to create multiple, language-specific retention plans in order to supply retention folder names in different languages. This is no longer necessary in Enterprise Vault 12.3 and later; you can now create one retention plan that supplies alternative names of the retention folders in multiple languages.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>To determine each user's preferred language, Enterprise Vault checks either the regional settings of the Exchange mailbox (for an Exchange archive) or the chosen language setting in Enterprise Vault Search (for an Internet Mail archive). If the preferred language is one that Enterprise Vault does not support, or Enterprise Vault does support the language but you have not supplied alternative folder names for it, then the folder names in Enterprise Vault's default language are used.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>You can supply the alternative names of the retention folders when you set up the folders using the Administration Console or when you define their attributes in an XML file.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
