Smart partitions do not have an automatic rollover capability. In addition, multiple smart partitions can be open for archiving at the same time. This is not true of standard vault store partitions, which are limited to one open partition for each vault store.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Each vault store must contain at least one partition, which is the physical location where Enterprise Vault stores archived data. As the data in a vault store grows, you can create more partitions to provide additional capacity.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>You can manually change the open partition in a vault store. For example, when the disk that hosts the open partition reaches capacity, close the partition and open a partition on a different disk.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Enterprise Vault also provides an automatic partition rollover feature. This feature lets you configure partitions so that archiving rolls over from one partition to another when certain criteria are met. For example, you can configure a partition to roll over to the next available partition when the host disk has only 5% free space. You can also configure a partition to roll over on a specific date.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>In support of both these features, each partition can exist in one of three states:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Closed. A partition that is closed, is not available for archiving until you manually open it, or make it ready for partition rollover.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Open. Each vault store can have only one open partition. Enterprise Vault archives data into the open partition. Without partition rollover, Enterprise Vault automatically closes a partition when the disk that hosts it becomes full, but does not open another.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>However, if the open partition is rollover enabled, and a ready partition exists, Enterprise Vault automatically opens the ready partition when the open partition meets its rollover criteria.</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Ready. Each vault store can have any number of ready partitions that are available to Enterprise Vault when partition rollover occurs.</span></div></div></div></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
