You can configure this recovery feature on the Archive Settings tab of site properties.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>If recovery is enabled, Enterprise Vault retains deleted items for the period of time that is specified on the Archive Settings tab of Site Properties. At the end of that time the item is permanently deleted.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>When a user deletes an archived item, it is removed from the index so that the item can no longer be found by browsing or searching the archive. However, direct links to the item, such as mailbox shortcuts, still work. The deleted item no longer contributes to the archive quota usage.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note that a user can retrieve a copy of a deleted item by using a shortcut. If the user then rearchives this item without modifying it, the item is still in a deleted state and therefore is not searchable.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Recovery is available only for those items that users have deleted. You cannot recover items that Enterprise Vault has deleted because their retention periods have expired or that third-party applications have deleted for compliance with data protection legislation. Also, if Storage Expiry deletes an item that has already been deleted by a user, you cannot then recover that item.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>To recover items that have been deleted from an archive</span></div></div></div><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>In the Administration Console, expand the tree view until the </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Archives</b><span> container is visible.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Expand the </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Archives</b><span> container and then click the container that has the archive with the deleted items.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Right-click the archive with the deleted items and, on the shortcut menu, click </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Properties</b><span>.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Click the </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Deleted Items</b><span> tab.
