During the time between archiving and removal, Enterprise Vault treats the original items as safety copies. For each vault store you can choose to keep the safety copies on the Enterprise Vault storage queue rather than in the original locations. This option has the advantage that the original items are removed immediately after archiving so users benefit from an immediate space gain.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>When the vault store partition has been backed up, Enterprise Vault can remove the safety copies.
