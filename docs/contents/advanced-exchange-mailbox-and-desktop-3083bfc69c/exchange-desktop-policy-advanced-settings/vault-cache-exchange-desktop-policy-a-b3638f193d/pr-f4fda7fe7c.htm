The process is known as preemptive caching. Preemptive caching takes place on the user's computer. It reduces the number of items that need to be downloaded from the mailbox archive to the Vault Cache when the two are synchronized.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Preemptive caching obeys the settings in the Exchange mailbox policy's archiving rules.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The Outlook Add-In uses the Preemptive archiving in advance value when it determines the age of items on which to perform preemptive caching. To determine the age, it deducts the Preemptive archiving in advance value from the Archive items when they are older than value in the Exchange mailbox policy's archiving rules.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For example, you do not change Preemptive archiving in advance from its default value. You set the Archive items when they are older than mailbox policy setting to six weeks. The Outlook Add-In deducts the Preemptive archiving in advance default value of seven days from six weeks, and preemptively caches the items that are five weeks old or older.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Note that if you use an archiving strategy that includes quotas, it is difficult to predict the age at which items are archived. It is then usually advantageous to preemptively cache items as soon as possible.
