You can choose to make Enterprise Vault keep the safety copies on the storage queue. The advantage is that the space soon becomes available at the original location. For example, a user who archives an item sees the quota usage reduce almost immediately instead of waiting until the next backup.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The storage queue location should be on a fault-tolerant device (RAID 1 or higher). The device must have sufficient space for all items on the queue. If you intend to use the storage queue for safety copies then there must be enough space to keep them until after the next backup.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For performance information about the Storage queue see the Enterprise Vault </span><i class="ph i display-inline">Performance Guide</i><span> at the following location:</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><a class="xref" href="https://www.veritas.com/docs/100000918" data-attr-href="https://www.veritas.com/docs/100000918" data-attr-format="html" data-attr-scope="external">https://www.veritas.com/docs/100000918</a></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Applications may use the storage queue for safety copies regardless of the vault store properties settings in the Administration Console.
