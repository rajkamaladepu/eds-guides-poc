For example, you can set up classification rules to look for personally identifiable information in items, such as credit card numbers, and assign to those items a retention category that marks them as non-records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Alternatively, suppose that you want to mark all the items in a specific archive as permanent records. To do this, you can set up a classification rule that checks the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">archiveid</i><span> property of each item and, when this matches a specified archive identifier, assign a retention category that marks the item as a permanent record. In a rule that uses the Veritas Information Classifier method to assign the evtag.category property to items, you might configure the appropriate parameter like this:</span></div></div></div><span class="placement-break align-"><img src="" class="image" data-attr-placement="break"></span><div class="p"><div><div><span>By using rules such as this, you can reclassify existing items in an archive to mark them as records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>An item may sometimes match several classification rules, all of which are competing to assign a retention category to it. Where this is the case, retention categories that mark items as records take precedence over those that do not. Retention categories that mark items as permanent records take precedence over those that mark them as temporary records, and these take precedence over retention categories that mark items as any other type of record.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For more information on how to use the Enterprise Vault classification feature, see the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">Classification</i><span> guides.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
