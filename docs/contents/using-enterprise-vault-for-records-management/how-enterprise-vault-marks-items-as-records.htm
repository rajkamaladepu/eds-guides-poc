Changing this behavior, however, is simply a matter of configuring the retention categories that Enterprise Vault assigns to the archived items. You can configure each retention category so that, at the same time that Enterprise Vault assigns the retention category to an item, it also marks the item as a record of some sort. With a range of different retention categories to assign to items, you can mark each item as the appropriate type of record.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Enterprise Vault provides several ways to assign the required retention category to an item and thereby mark it as a record or non-record. For instance, you can do the following:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Create one or more retention plans, each of which is associated with a different retention category. Then you can set up multiple provisioning groups to apply the required retention plans to selected user mailboxes.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>For example, suppose that you want to mark all the items of certain Exchange users as permanent records by default. You can configure a retention category to mark items as permanent records, associate it with a retention plan, and then apply the retention plan to the target mailboxes that you have defined in an Exchange provisioning group. You can use similar methods to mark the items of other users with a different record type, such as temporary.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>See </span><a class="xref" href="setting-the-default-record-type-for-users.md" data-attr-href="setting-the-default-record-type-for-users.md" data-attr-format="dita" data-attr-type="topic">Setting the default record type for users</a><span>.</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>By using facilities such as Enterprise Vault Policy Manager (EVPM), assign different retention categories to different folders in user mailboxes. Then you can allow users to mark their items as permanent records, temporary records, or non-records by dragging the items from one mailbox folder and dropping them in another.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>For example, suppose that you have applied a retention plan that marks all the items of certain users as permanent records by default. To allow these users to mark selected items as temporary records or non-records, you can use EVPM to add folders called "Temporary Records" and "Personal" to their mailboxes. The "Temporary Records" folder has a retention category that marks items as temporary records, whereas the "Personal" folder has a retention category that does not mark them as records. Users can then drag and drop items into the appropriate folder to change the record types of the items.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>See </span><a class="xref" href="allowing-users-to-change-the-record-types-of-individual-items.md" data-attr-href="allowing-users-to-change-the-record-types-of-individual-items.md" data-attr-format="dita" data-attr-type="topic">Allowing users to change the record types of individual items</a><span>.</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Use the Enterprise Vault classification feature to assign the appropriate retention category to items that match certain criteria.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>For example, you can set up classification rules to look for items that contain personally identifiable information, such as credit card numbers, and assign to those items a retention category that marks them as non-records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>See </span><a class="xref" href="using-the-classification-feature-for-records-management.md" data-attr-href="using-the-classification-feature-for-records-management.md" data-attr-format="dita" data-attr-type="topic">Using the classification feature for records management</a><span>.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
