However, a drawback of doing this is that it may override the retention categories that the classification feature has assigned to the items. For the purpose of assigning non-default retention categories to individual items, it is therefore advisable to choose either EVPM or the classification feature, but not both.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>If you use the classification feature for records management, we recommend that you set your classification policies to always prevent retention category updates for moved items. </span><a class="xref" href="potential-conflicts-between-evpm-and-the-classification-feature.md" data-attr-href="potential-conflicts-between-evpm-and-the-classification-feature.md#v121697699" data-attr-format="dita">Figure: Settings tab of Classification Policy Properties dialog box</a><span> shows how you might achieve this.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Figure: Settings tab of Classification Policy Properties dialog box</span></div></div></div><span class="placement-break align-"><img src="" class="image" data-attr-placement="break"></span></div></div></body></html>
