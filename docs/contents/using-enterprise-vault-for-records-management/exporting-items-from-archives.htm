For example, in the Capstone approach to records management, it is customary to make periodic transfers of permanent records to the U.S. National Archives. The following webpage provides guidance on how to make these transfers:</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><a class="xref" href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html" data-attr-href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html" data-attr-format="html" data-attr-scope="external">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html</a></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The National Archives does not have an interest in temporary records or non-records, so there is no need to transfer them.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Enterprise Vault comes with two PowerShell cmdlets with which you can export selected items from an archive. </span><a class="xref" href="exporting-items-from-archives.md" data-attr-href="exporting-items-from-archives.md#v118767765" data-attr-format="dita">Table: PowerShell cmdlets for exporting items</a><span> describes these cmdlets.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><b class="ph b display-inline">Table: PowerShell cmdlets for exporting items</b></div></div></div><div class="table-headcount-1"><div><div>Cmdlet</div><div>Description</div></div><div><div>Export-EVArchive</div><div>Exports items from the specified archive. You can limit the export to items that match the specified search criteria. For example, you can export only those items that were received, sent, or created in the last month. You can choose to export the items in a range of formats, including EML and PST. By default, the cmdlet exports each item in its original format: MSG for Microsoft Exchange items, EML for SMTP items, TXT for text files, and so on.</div></div><div><div>Export-EVNARAArchive</div><div>Exports only those items that Enterprise Vault has marked as permanent records. You can limit the export to records that fall within the specified date range and/or match the specified search criteria. As with Export-EVArchive , you can export the items in a range of formats. Export-EVNARAArchive also creates a load file in comma-separated value ( .csv ) format, which you can send to the National Archives with the items. For each item that the cmdlet has successfully exported, the load file provides the following information: The file name of the exported item. For exports to PST, the load file shows the name of the PST file. The record ID. A title. For messages, this is the subject line; for other items, it is the original file name. A description, which is derived from the indexed content of the item. By default, Enterprise Vault indexes the full content of each item and treats the first 128 characters as a preview string for display in search results. It is this string that appears in the load file. However, you can configure the indexing settings at the site or archive level to increase the preview length or switch to brief indexing, which does not index the contents of items at all. Any changes that you make to these settings are reflected in the description that appears in the load file. The creator of the item. The date on which the item was created. For exports to PST only, the location of the item in the PST folder structure.</div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For instructions on how to run these cmdlets, see the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">PowerShell Cmdlets</i><span> guide.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
