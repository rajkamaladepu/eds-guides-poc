However, it may not be appropriate to submit all these items to the U.S. National Archives because, for example, they contain unimportant information or personal information. By using the classification feature, you can instruct Enterprise Vault to look for and mark such items as temporary records or even non-records. The following procedure outlines how to do this. The procedure takes SMTP users as an example, but you can readily adapt it to suit other types of users.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>When Enterprise Vault indexes and classifies items, the following procedure causes it to assign the retention category "Permanent Retention Category" to the items and mark them as permanent records. However, any items that match a classification rule receive a different retention category and are consequently marked as either temporary records or non-records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>For instructions on how to use the Enterprise Vault classification feature, see the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">Classification</i><span> guides.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>To configure users as Capstone officials but use classification to exclude certain items from the permanent record set</span></div></div></div><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Create a retention category that is called, for example, "Permanent Retention Category".
