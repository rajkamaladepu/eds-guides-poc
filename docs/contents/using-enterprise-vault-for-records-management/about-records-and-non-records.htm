Each record can be of two types: permanent or temporary. Items that do not meet the legal definition of a record are classed as non-records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Permanent records</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Permanent records are of historical value and worthy of long-term preservation in the U.S. National Archives. According to the Capstone guidelines, the following people are likely to send or receive items that are suitable for marking as permanent records:</span></div></div></div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Officials at the higher levels of federal agencies or component organizations.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Other staff members who regularly create or receive emails that are presumed to be of permanent value.</span></div></div></div></li><li class="li"><div class="p"><div><div><span>Anyone else who creates or receives emails of permanent value.</span></div></div></div></li></ul><div class="p"><div><div><span>The U.S. National Archives recommends that agencies consult the </span><i class="ph i display-inline">United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions</i><span> (Plum Book), </span><i class="ph i display-inline">U .S. Government Manual</i><span> , and other sources when assigning permanent account status. In this chapter, the term "Capstone officials" refers to those people for whom it may be appropriate to mark their emails as permanent records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>To simplify the process of records management, Capstone recommends that every email in the accounts of such people is treated as a permanent record by default. However, Capstone acknowledges that certain emails may not be worthy of preservation. In these instances, the account users have the option to mark the emails as non-permanent.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>The Capstone approach requires federal agencies to make periodic transfers of permanent records to the National Archives. Depending on the security classification of the records, the National Archives may then make them publicly available.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Temporary records</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Temporary records may contain government or business information but are of limited value. A federal agency does not transfer such records to the National Archives but still needs to retain them for a set period of time, based on the agency's needs.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Capstone recommends that those people who are not high-level policy makers but who may send or receive emails that constitute records have all their emails marked as temporary records by default. Again, however, Capstone gives these people the option to mark certain emails as either permanent records or non-records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>In this chapter, the term "Capstone non-officials" refers to those people for whom it may be appropriate to mark their emails as temporary records.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Non-records</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>Non-records are items that do not contain any government or business information, such as personal emails and charitable solicitations. Those people who have their emails marked as permanent records or temporary records by default also have the option to mark individual emails as non-records, where appropriate.</span></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
